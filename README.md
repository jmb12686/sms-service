A simple way to send SMS text messages.

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS IAM User Credentials for programmatic access**

   This module utilizes Amazon SNS for sending SMS messages.  As such, this will require an AWS account and an **IAM User** with **programmatic access** keys.  The aws-sdk has a number of options for setting AWS credentials.  [Refer to the official AWS documentation for further instruction.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html)

2. **IAM Policy for SNS**

   The AWS IAM user will require proper IAM policy permissions to publish SMS messages.  The SMS publish feature in SNS does not (for now) have a unique AWS resource, and thus there are no ideal ways to lock down access control.  However, here is a sample policy allowing access to only publish SMS messages while denying access to publish on topics, applications, and push notifications:

   ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Deny",
                "Action": [
                    "sns:Publish"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:sns:*:*:*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "sns:Publish"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    If you know the set of recipients before hand, you can further tighten access control permissions by listing specific phone numbers in the last `Resource` node.

## Installation

1. **Install via npm:**

   ```bash
   npm install sms-service
   ```

## Usage

Within your javascript application, you can use the SMSService to send SMS text messages:

```javascript
//initialize
const sms = require('sms-service');
const smsService = new sms.SMSService();


async smsService.sendSMS('15555555555','hello from sms-service!');

```

The phoneNumber format **must be in E.164 format**.  For example, a USA based number of *555-555-5555*, the service would require *15555555555*.

### Debug Logging

Debug logging is provided by [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug), and can be turned on setting the environment variable `DEBUG`.

PowerShell Example:

```ps

$env:DEBUG = "*"
```

Bash:

```bash
export DEBUG=*
```

## Contributing

### Automated Publish

1. Utilizing GitHub Actions, after committing / merging changes into master, simply use `npm version` command to force a release on GitHub and trigger the workflow:

    ```bash
    npm version 1.1.4 -m "Upgrade to %s for reasons"
    ```

### Manual Publish

1. After merging feature branch changes back into master, follow semver and bump git version tag:

    ```bash
    git tag -a 1.X.X -m "adding version XXX"
    ```

2. bump npm module version:

    ```bash
    npm version from-git
    ```

    Note: `npm version` also will push all git commits and tags to origin.  This was configured in the `package.json` scripts:

    ```json
        "version": "npm run format && git add -A src",
        "postversion": "git push && git push --tags"
    ```

3. publish new release to npm:

    ```bash
    npm publish
    ```
